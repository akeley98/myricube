/**

If desired some samples may want to easily switch between different
allocator classes.

This file will include the appropriate nvvk::Allocator? class depending 
on one of three possible defines that must be set prior to including:

- NVVK_ALLOC_DEDICATED : nvvk::AllocatorDedicated is a naive implementation that allocates one VkDeviceMemory per resource (VkBuffer/VkImage).
  This is not a recommended practice, but useful for basic testing and low complexity in the samples.
- NVVK_ALLOC_DMA : nvvk::AllocatorDma uses the nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator class to allocate VkDeviceMemory in chunks, which
  lowers the amount of overall allocations. This practice is recommended for Vulkan resource management
  in general. There are limits on the amount of allocations that can be fairly low, and there is also a performance
  penalty going through the OS to make such allocations.  
  Furthermore this allocator class uses nvvk::StagingMemoryManagerDma
  which uses multiple chunks of VkBuffers for staging memory. The motivation is the same as for memory, we reduce
  the amount of Vulkan object creations, by sub-allocating temporary space from a VkBuffer that is mapped to
  host to aid the upload process.
- NVVK_ALLOC_VMA : nvvk::AllocatorVma makes use of the [VMA](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
  and works similar to the `DMA` variant above, it also makes use of nvvk::StagingMemoryManagerVma.


It also provides structs such as nvvk::Image nvvk::Buffer etc. that map to the appropriate
structs, e.g. nvvk::ImageDma.

See more details in description of [nvvk::AllocatorDma](#class-nvvkallocatordma).
