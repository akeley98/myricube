# This is a comment
# Simple syntax for binding keys, every nonempty line should be
# a whitespace-separated pair of {key name} {KeyTarget name}.
#
# Note: to override these controls, mimic the syntax of this file
# in a file named keybinds.txt in this directory. This way, your
# custom keybinds will not be detected by git.
